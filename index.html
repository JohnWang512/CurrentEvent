<h1>Building a Smart Kitchen</h1>
    
<p>Summary<br>
When it comes to getting help at home, people are putting technology to work. Robots have already taken over many of the tasks that most people consider a chore.Amazon is what we call the "magical button".You can order whatever you want online and you will receive it.The HAPI Fork is something that know if you are eating too fast,eating fast is bad for your body.The Smarter FridgeCam is something that can see what is inside the fridge.It can suggest recipes based on ingredients you already have at home.</p>
    
<p>Is the article controversial?<br>
This article is not controversial because there is only one thinking which what is really happening around the world.The author did not disagree with it.</p>
    
<p>Bias<br>
I think that this article has no bais because the publisher only wrote down what is really happening around the world these days.</p>

<p>My Opinion<br>
In my opinion I think that we should not go on Amazon and order some food for parties or something,It is bad for our environment because of all the waste. Sometimes technology is in a good way but sometimes it is not that great, it is making people very lazy these days.We should use The Smarter FridgeCam and the HAPI Fork which are both great choices of building a smart kitchen. </p>
